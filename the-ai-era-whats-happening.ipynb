It's amazing how well the ai applications perform now, it was not obvious the ai that just outputs some random text is now able to solve complex, real-world problems tailored to individual needs.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# So what happened in just the last 2 years?\n\nai stack \n\nMulti modals \n\nedge ai \n\nAgentic workflow:\n- Reflection: iterate\n- Tool use\n- Planning / rasoning: sequence of steps\n- Multi agent collaboration \n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"great example of agentic ai:\nhttps://va.landing.ai/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
